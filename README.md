# Operating-Systems-P5

## Changes made as of now:
- syscall.h
- wmap.h
- syscall.c
- sysproc.c
- vm.c
- proc.h
- trap.c
- made a new file called wmaptest.c
- Makefile
- user.h
- usys.S
- this kind of completes the task 1 of the project to implement the wmap() system call but I need to still make sure the test cases pass.
